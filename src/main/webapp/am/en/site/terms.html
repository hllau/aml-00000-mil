Some partners may advise of different earning/crediting procedures which should then be followed by members.</li>

<li>If a temporary Asia Miles membership card is presented to earn mileage credits, the member is required to use and provide a name that is identical to the one submitted on his Asia Miles application form.</li>

<li>Only certain transactions with partners are eligible to earn mileage credits. These are or will be outlined in Asia Miles website at <a href="http://www.asiamiles.com/">www.asiamiles.com</a> and from time to time may be specifically published by AML and/or partners.</li>

<li>For promotions restricted to a particular market, residency is determined by the member's preferred mailing address as registered with Asia Miles.</li>

<li>Mileage credits will only be officially recorded upon the acceptance of an Asia Miles membership application and approval of membership status.</li>

<li>Mileage credits are not transferable to other airline programmes and AML does not accept the conversion of reward points of other airlines to mileage credits.</li>

<li>Mileage credits are not transferable to other non-airline partner programmes. Except in cases where specified in the programme information, such as MoneyBack.</li>

<li>The reward points of credit and charge card partners, certain hotel partners, telecoms partners and petrol station partners can be converted to Asia Miles. Details of these partners and the relevant conversion details can be obtained at <a href="http://www.asiamiles.com/">www.asiamiles.com</a>.</li>

<li>Members can exchange reward programme currencies between Asia Miles and other partners.</li>

<li>In order to be eligible for mileage credits, members must make sure that the name used in a transaction especially when printed on airline tickets, exactly matches the name as registered with Asia Miles.</li>

<li>Mileage credits may take between 4 to 6 weeks after travel or transaction to be credited to member’s account. Some mileage credit transactions may have different processing times depending on the partner.</li>

<li>Mileage credits are valid for redemption awards as soon as they are credited to member's account.</li>

<li>Mileage credits are valid for three years from the date of accrual.</li>

There is no minimum mileage earned guarantee. Mileage earned is not affected by complimentary upgrades or involuntary downgrades.</li>

								<p><ol class="noindent">
<li>For round-trip awards, Upgrade Awards and Companion Award Travel on single or dual carriers, the award miles requirements are based on the one-way actual miles between the origin airport and destination airport. Where the sum of the outbound one-way distance and the inbound one-way distance are not the same, the longer distance shall be used to determine the award zone.</li>

<li>The member or the Nominee may make two stopovers, two transfers or one open-jaw at either the origin, en route or turnaround point on all airline partners except Air China and Iberia where no stopovers or open-jaws are permitted. If the open-jaw is at the origin, the member or Nominee must return to the country of origin, though not necessarily to the same city. The member must depart from the intermediate point on the next available connecting flight. The preceding is all subject to airline partners' terms and conditions. For the purposes of this section, open-jaw means a flight itinerary where the departure city is different from the returning city, or alternatively, the destination city that a passenger arrives in is different from the one he/she returns from on the return portion of the trip.</li>

<li>For multiple sector award travel, the mileage credits required are that of the highest class booked in any single itinerary.</li>

<li>For one-way award travel, the sum of the total sectors to be flown will count for redemption purposes. In such circumstances, only one en route stopover is allowed.&nbsp;</li>

<li>To redeem a <b>one</b>world Multi-Carrier Award, the total mileage credits required in determining the award zone is the sum of the sector distance (between the origin airports and destination airports) of all sectors in the itinerary. The member or Nominee can make a maximum of five stopovers. In addition, two transfers and two open-jaws are permitted.</li>
